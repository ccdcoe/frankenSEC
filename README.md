# frankenSEC

This repository contains SEC event correlation rules used for XS17 yellow team data processing. More information about the tool can be found in [official documentation](https://simple-evcorr.github.io/man.html). As the name may suggest, the contents are a Frankenstein monster of packaged SEC rules originally developed as part of a [master thesis](https://github.com/markuskont/SagittariuSEC) and various code cobbled together during [frankencoding event](https://github.com/ccdcoe/Frankencoding).
